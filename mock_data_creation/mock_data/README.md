# Mock Data Details
* `split_0.txt`: base noise = prediction corruption at corruption probability = 0.25 (no attribute; corrupt uniformly across other classes) 
* `split_1.txt`: corrupt goose images with sketch attribute at corruption probability = 0.6 (corrupt uniformly across other classes) with base noise (see above)
