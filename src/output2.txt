1. Incorrect step selection
added this in the prompt: - Justify each action and the object class it related to based on the context.
2. Reasoning should include which class to select; then Slice condition selected the third best
3. Even though enough information is provided in gather observations, it repeats gathering (gather_observations again only if it's previously not mentioned)


4. Missing in top 5 observations, class is too rare


5. In prune says conclusion but the next step ends up being action? or the conclusion is stated as step 3 gather observations
6.
